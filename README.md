# pan2020_authorship_verification

This repository contains the source code used to generate my model for the pan 2020 authorship verification shared task: https://pan.webis.de/clef20/pan20-web/author-identification.html

The training datasets are not included in the repository and can be downloaded from: https://pan.webis.de/data.html

I have included the trained models that were used in my submission.

Our approach is described in:
